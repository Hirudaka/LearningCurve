## Basic Level

1. What is object orient programming ?
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual object are grouped into classes. OOPs implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

2. Why use OOPs? OR Advantages of OOP ?
- OOPS allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems
- Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy Data and code are bound together by encapsulation
- OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
- Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
- The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms

3. What are the main features/pillars of OOPs?
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

4. What is a class?
- A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common to the objects present within that class.

5. What is an object?
- An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

6. What is the difference between a class and a structure?

- Class: User-defined blueprint from which objects are created. It consists of methods or sets of instructions that are to be performed on the objects.
- Structure: A structure is basically a user-defined collection of variables which are of different data types.

7. What is inheritance?

- Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes to inherit common properties from other classes. For example, if there is a class such as 'vehicle', other classes like 'car', 'bike', etc can inherit common properties from the vehicle class. This property helps you get rid of redundant code thereby reducing the overall size of the code.

8. What are the different types of inheritance?

- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Hybrid inheritance

10. What is the difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance?

11. What is hierarchical inheritance?

- Hierarchical inheritance refers to inheritance where one base class has more than one subclass. For example, the vehicle class can have 'car', 'bike', etc as its subclasses.

12. In computer science, what is algorithms ?

- Algorithms are a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. providing clear instructions on what to do.

13. What are the limitations of inheritance?

- Increases the time and effort required to execute a program as it requires jumping back and forth between different classes
- The parent class and the child class get tightly coupled
- Any modifications to the program would require changes both in the parent as well as the child class
- Needs careful implementation else would lead to incorrect results.

14. What is a superclass?

- A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other class or classes. For example, the Vehicle class is a superclass of class Car.

15. What is a subclass?

- A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass. For example, the class Car is a subclass or a derived of Vehicle class.

16.  What is polymorphism?

- Polymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple definitions can be given to asingle interface. For example, if you have a class named Vehicle. it can have a method named speed but you cannot define it because different vehicles have different speeds. This method will be defined in the subclasses with different definitions for different vehicles.

17.  What is function/method overloading?

- Method overloading is a feature of OOPs which makes it possible to give the same name to more than one method within a class if the arguments passed differ.

18. What is function/method overriding?

- Method overriding is a feature of OOPs by which the child class or the subclass can redefine methods present in the base class or parent class. Here. the method that is overridden has the same name as well as the signature meaning the arguments passed and the return type.

19. What is encapsulation?

- Encapsulation refers to binding the data and the code that works on that together in a single unit. For example, a class. Encapsulation also allows data-hiding as the data specified in one class is hidden from other classes.

20. What is data abstraction?

- Data abstraction is a very important feature of OOPs that allows displaying only the important information and hiding the implementation details. For example, while riding a bike. you know that if you raise the accelerator. the speed will increase, but you don't know how it actually happens. This is data abstraction as the implementation details are hidden from the rider.

21. What is an abstract class?

- An abstract class is a class that consists of abstract methods. These methods are basically declared but not defined. If these methods are to be used in some subclass, they need to be exclusively defined in the subclass.

22. What is a constructor?

- A constructor is a special type of method that has the same name as the class and is used to initialize objects of that class.

23. What is a destructor?

- A destructor is a method that is automatically invoked when an object is destroyed. The destructor also recovers the heap space that was allocated to the destroyed object. closes the files and database connections of the object. etc.
