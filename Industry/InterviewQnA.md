1. What is object orient programming ?
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual object are grouped into classes. OOPs implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

2. Why use OOPs? OR Advantages of OOP ?
- OOPS allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems
- Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy Data and code are bound together by encapsulation
- OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
- Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
- The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms

3. What are the main features/pillars of OOPs?
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

4. What is a class?
- A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common to the objects present within that class.

5. What is an object?
- An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

6. What is the difference between a class and a structure?

- Class: User-defined blueprint from which objects are created. It consists of methods or sets of instructions that are to be performed on the objects.
- Structure: A structure is basically a user-defined collection of variables which are of different data types.
